# Fraud-Detection
Contains a project showcasing how to detect credit card fraud. In it we explore the credit card fraud dataset located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

We also see how we can do sampling with a class imbalance, training a logistic regression model and a XGBoost model, trying out different hyperparameters, performance metrics and also we use SMOTE to up-sample and generate synthetic data for the minority class in our dataset.

Technologies used:
* Python
* Scikit-Learn
* XGBoost
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Numpy
